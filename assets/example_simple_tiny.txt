[0:00:00] Fantastic. I'll just check if we've got some questions from the audience out there, but
[0:00:09] was we're actually waiting for that. Don't know, I just want to come back to you in sort
[0:00:13] of enlisting in on the private sector component. Have you seen private sector in your work
[0:00:20] coming to be engaged, for instance, within the red cross system or coming to approach
[0:00:25] you and say we can support you in how you respond to disasters in certain areas or
[0:00:31] how we can support you in terms of moving forward and prepare those communities should
[0:00:35] another disaster hit them.
[0:00:37] Yes, very much so. I fully agree that the private sector's engagement has really increased tremendously
[0:00:43] through the years. Even if they humanitarian work, we see them helping us test, you know,
[0:00:49] whatever approaches like the forecast base financing where we are actually trying to
[0:00:54] act beforehand and act based on forecast and test this in various communities and
[0:01:00] even business models. I think through the years because we continuously experience extreme events
[0:01:09] and the communities and private sectors, even government, are already finding ways to work
[0:01:17] together and to actually address the situation and bring in different expertise. So the
[0:01:24] scientists bring in the science, the private sector, bring in the business model and then
[0:01:29] the communities bring in the actions on the ground. I think everyone now is headed towards
[0:01:35] this common mindset that we need to do more together and in a fast way. So yes, I think
[0:01:42] it's very encouraging to see the coherence convergence. So for private sector, communities,
[0:01:50] scientists and government in this group.
[0:01:53] That's fantastic to hear about the convergence and now everybody is converging to the middle
[0:01:57] and trying to provide solutions. There is a question here that says,
