 fantastic. I'll just check if we've got some questions from the audience out there, but was we're actually waiting for that. Don't know, I just want to come back to you in sort of in listening in on the private sector component. Have you seen private sector in your work coming to be engaged, for instance, within the red cross system or coming to approach you and see we can support you in how you do with how you respond to disasters in certain areas or how we can support you in terms of moving forward and prepare those communities should another disaster hit them.

[0:00:37] SPEAKER_00

 Yes, very much so. I fully agree that the private sectors engagement has really increased tremendously through the years, even in the humanitarian work. We see them helping us test, you know, a bunch of approaches like the forecast base financing where we are actually trying to act beforehand and act based on forecast and test this in various communities and even business models. I think through the years, because we continuously experience extreme events and the communities and private sectors, even government, are already finding ways to work together and to actually address the situation and bring in different expertise. So the scientists bring in the science, the private sector, bring in the business model, and then the communities bring in the actions on the ground. I think everyone now is headed towards this common mindset that we need to do more together and in a fast way. So yes, I think it's very encouraging to see the coherence convergence of private sector, communities, scientists and government in this group.
