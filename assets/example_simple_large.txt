[0:00:00] Fantastic. I'll just check if we've got some questions from the audience out there. But
[0:00:09] whilst we're actually waiting for that, Donna, I just want to come back to you. In listening in
[0:00:14] on the private sector component, have you seen private sector in your work coming to be engaged,
[0:00:21] for instance, within the Red Cross system or coming to approach you and say we can support
[0:00:26] you in how you respond to disasters in certain areas or how we can support you in terms of
[0:00:33] moving forward and prepare those communities should another disaster hit them? Yes, very much
[0:00:38] so. I fully agree that the private sector's engagement has really increased tremendously
[0:00:43] through the years. Even in the humanitarian work, we see them helping us test innovative approaches
[0:00:50] like the forecast-based financing where we are actually trying to act beforehand and act
[0:00:56] based on the data that we have. So, I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really
[0:00:56] good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think it's
[0:00:56] really good point. I think it's important to think about the impact of this on forecasts and test
[0:00:58] this in various communities and even business models. I think through the years, because we
[0:01:07] continuously experience extreme events and the communities and private sectors, even government,
[0:01:15] are already finding ways to work together and to actually address the situation and bring in
[0:01:23] different expertise. So the scientist brings in the science and the knowledge. So, it's always
[0:01:26] the private sector brings in the business model, and then the communities brings in the
[0:01:31] actions on the ground. I think everyone now is headed towards this common mindset that we need to do more together
[0:01:38] and in a fast way.
[0:01:40] So yes, I think it's very encouraging to see the
[0:01:47] coherence, convergence of private sector, communities, scientists, and government in this group.
[0:01:52] That's fantastic to hear about the convergence. Now everybody's kind of converging to the middle and trying to provide solutions.
[0:01:58] There is a question here that says, are there
