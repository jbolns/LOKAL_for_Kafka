[0:00:00] I will check if we have questions from the audience out there.
[0:00:09] Whilst we are waiting for that, I want to come back to you.
[0:00:13] In listening in on the private sector component, have you seen private sector in your work
[0:00:20] coming to be engaged, for instance, within the Red Cross system or coming to approach
[0:00:25] you and say we can support you in how you respond to disasters in certain areas or how
[0:00:32] we can support you in terms of moving forward and prepare those communities should another
[0:00:35] disaster hit them?
[0:00:37] Yes, very much so.
[0:00:39] I fully agree that the private sector's engagement has really increased tremendously through
[0:00:43] the years.
[0:00:45] Even in the humanitarian work, we see them helping us test innovative approaches like
[0:00:50] the forecast-based financing where we are actually trying to act beforehand and act
[0:00:56] based on forecast and test this in various communities and even business models.
[0:01:03] I think through the years, because we continuously experience extreme events and the communities
[0:01:13] and private sectors, even government, are already finding ways to work together and
[0:01:18] to actually address the situation and bring in different expertise.
[0:01:24] The scientists bring in the science, the private sector brings in the business model, and then
[0:01:29] the communities bring in the actions on the ground.
[0:01:33] I think everyone now is headed towards this common mindset that we need to do more together
[0:01:38] and in a fast way.
[0:01:42] I think it's very encouraging to see the convergence of private sector, scientists,
[0:01:50] and government in this room.
[0:01:53] That's fantastic to hear about the convergence.
[0:01:55] Now everybody is converging to the middle and trying to provide solutions.
[0:01:58] There is a question here.
