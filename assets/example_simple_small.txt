[0:00:00] Fantastic. I'll just check if we've got some questions from the audience out there. But
[0:00:09] whilst we're actually waiting for that, Donna, I just want to come back to you in sort of
[0:00:13] in listening in on the private sector component. Have you seen private sector in your work
[0:00:20] coming to be engaged, for instance, within the Red Cross system or coming to approach
[0:00:25] you and say we can support you in how you respond to disasters in certain areas or how
[0:00:32] we can support you in terms of moving forward and prepare those communities should another
[0:00:36] disaster hit them? Yes, very much so. I fully agree that the private sector's engagement
[0:00:41] has really increased tremendously through the years. Even in the humanitarian work, we
[0:00:46] see them helping us test innovative approaches like the forecast-based financing, where we
[0:00:52] are actually trying to act beforehand and act based on forecasts and test this in various
[0:00:59] communities and even business models. I think through the years, because we continuously
[0:01:08] experience extreme events and the communities and private sectors, even government, are already
[0:01:15] finding ways to work together and to actually address the situation and bring in different
[0:01:23] expertise. So the scientist brings in the science, the private sector brings in the business model,
[0:01:29] and then the communities brings in the actions on the ground. I think everyone now is headed
[0:01:34] towards this common mindset that we need to do more together and in a fast way. So yes, I think
[0:01:42] it's very encouraging to see the coherence, convergence of private sector communities,
[0:01:50] scientists and government in this room. That's fantastic to hear about the convergence. Now
[0:01:55] everybody's kind of converging to the middle and trying to provide solutions. There is a question
[0:01:59] here that says,
