[0:00:00] Fantastic. I'll just check if we've got some questions from the audience out there, but
[0:00:09] whilst we're actually waiting for that, Donna, I just want to come back to you in sort
[0:00:13] of in listening in on the private sector component. Have you seen private sector in your
[0:00:20] work coming to be engaged, for instance, within the Red Cross system or coming to approach
[0:00:25] you and say we can support you in how you do with how you respond to disasters in certain
[0:00:30] areas or how we can support you in terms of moving forward and prepare those communities
[0:00:35] should another disaster hit them? Yes, very much so. I fully agree that the private
[0:00:40] sector's engagement has really increased tremendously through the years. Even in the humanitarian

[0:00:52] where we are actually trying to act beforehand and act based on forecasts and test this in various
[0:00:59] communities and even business models. I think through the years, because we continuously
[0:01:08] experience extreme events and the communities and private sectors, even government, are already
[0:01:15] finding ways to work together and to actually address the situation and bring in different
[0:01:23] expertise. So the scientist brings in the science, the private sector brings in the business model,
[0:01:29] and then the communities brings in the actions on the ground. I think everyone now is headed towards
[0:01:35] a common mindset that we need to do more together and in a fast way. So yes, I think it's very
[0:01:43] encouraging to see the coherence, convergence. So for private sector communities,
[0:01:50] scientists and government in this group. That's fantastic to hear about the convergence,
[0:01:54] and now everybody's kind of converging to the middle and trying to provide solutions.
[0:01:58] There is a question here that says, other
